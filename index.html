                <h2 id="aboutSection">About</h2>
                <p>I am a 22 year old 
                    programmer currently based out of Western New York.<br>
                    My passion for Computer Science was bred at 
                    Canisius College, where I recieved my Bachelor of Science
                    Degree for CS,<br>as well as the Computer Science Department 
                    Excellence in Academics Award. Although my college career
                    is over,<br>I continue to learn and better myself every day.
                    Coding is not just a hobby, or something to pay the bills,
                    it is my lifestyle. 
                </p>
                <p>Nowadays, I am self-teaching C# whilst solidifying and
                    supplementing the foundation of knowledge I have
                    gained over my computing career.<br>I enjoy spending my 
                    free time designing and implementing personal projects
                    (some of which you can see below),<br>as well as a host of other
                    activities that keep my mind and body sharp (as shown in the
                    'Hobbies' section).
                </p>
                <p>If you wish to contact me for more information about myself or the 
                    skillset I have to offer, please send me an email at 
                    mattconforti21@gmail.com,<br>and I will be sure to respond as soon 
                    as possible.<br><br>Thanks again for stopping by, and have a good one!

                    <!--
                    <p>Besides computing, my passions are sports, fitness, and strategy based games/activities.<br><br>
                    Basketball is by far my favorite sport, and I am an avid New York Knicks fan.<br>Despite the 
                    jokes and memes, the Knickerbockers will always be my team. I'll always support them, no matter 
                    the Win/Loss record.<br><br>I've played organized Basketball in a youth league and middle school,
                    as well as Baseball from Tee-ball to HS Varsity. I used to watch the New York Yankees when I was 
                    younger, but haven't since my playing days have been over. I still play basketball with
                    friends though, to this day.<br><br>

                    My fitness journey began super late compared to most of my peers.<br> While most of the kids I was
                    friends with in Middle School/High School played football and therefore actively did strength training, I did
                    nothing of the sort.<br>I took a core-based fitness class my sophmore year of High School, but was 
                    not really into working-out and sort of just went through the motions in class.<br>One day, 
                    fairly out of the blue, I decided I wanted to learn how to do pushups properly, and not just
                    jerk my body up and down like I had previously done (LOL). So, I worked my way up from my then
                    max 3 pushups to a whole 5 pushups. And then from 5 to 7, and from 7 to 10, and from 10 to 15,
                    15 to 20, etc. Weeks later, people in my family started to notice my skinny little frame adding
                    some thickness to it, and made comments. From there, I was hooked. I liked that I was feeling 
                    accomplished and healthy, and I enjoyed the fact that I could be in control of how I looked.<br>
                    I started to get more serious and I did some research on home dumbell workouts, and it took off
                    from there. I began to learn about different muscle groups and how to use them, and I really started
                    noticing jumps in strength. Around this time, I also started getting more serious about my diet. I've
                    had a fairly healthy diet all my life, but I never knew how much food impacted day to day affairs
                    within the body. I had tried veganism before, and lost too much weight. But, it gave me the ability
                    to learn how to make my own meals, which is a HUGE step in being healthy. From then on, I started
                    eating a lot leaner, cutting out dairy, watching what vitamins and nutrients I was taking in, and what I
                    was lacking. This all contributed to my overall health and fitness. I started my journey at 140 lbs 
                    and now I'm around 190, with very little fat gained. It has taken me about 5 years to really develop a
                    strong mind-muscle connection, and be in touch with my body and adhere to its wants and needs. Remember, 
                    train the body, train the mind! Those are the keys to a healthy, successful lifestyle.
                    <br><br>

                    As far as videogames, board games, etc. I enjoy anything that allows players to use skill and strategy.
                    This type of game really appeals to me because it allows players to use skill, their brains, past
                    experiences etc. (and not just rely on pure luck) to gain an advantage on opposing players. There are 
                    seldom flukes or upsets, and the outcome is based on the people involved, not predetermined or decided by some
                    arbitrary factor (like the roll of a dice). Games like Checkers, Scrabble, war games, Poker, etc. are all 
                    great examples of games that require skill and stragey over luck and chance.<br><br>

                    I also really enjoy spending time with family and friends. I believe a large part of who you are stems
                    from the people who you surround yourself with.<br>That being said, I always try to be around 
                    good energy and genuine people, and it seldom results in having bad times.
