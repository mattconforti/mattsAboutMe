                <p>Hello there! My name is Matt Conforti. Welcome to my 'about-me' page! 
                    This is a page designed solely using HTML and CSS.
                    <br><br>Here, you can learn a bit about me, what I do,
                    and see some of the work I've done.<br>Don't
                    be shy to reach out to me with questions or inquiries of any kind.
                    My contact info can be found below at the very bottom of the page.
                    <br><br>Thanks for visiting my site!
                </p>

                <h2 id="aboutSection">About</h2>
                <p>I am a 22 year old 
                    programmer currently based out of Royal Oak, Michigan.<br>
                    My passion for Computer Science was bred at 
                    Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. There, I recieved my Bachelor of Science
                    Degree for CS,<br>as well as the Computer Science Department 
                    Excellence in Academics Award. Although my college career
                    is over,<br>I continue to learn and better myself every day.
                    Coding is not just a hobby, or something to pay the bills,
                    it is my lifestyle. 
                </p>
                <p>Nowadays, I am self-teaching C# and solidifying the knowledge I have
                    gained over my still-young computing career.<br>I enjoy spending my 
                    free time designing and implementing personal projects
                    (some of which you can see below),<br>as well as a host of other
                    activities that keep my mind and body sharp.<br>These include weight 
                    training, strategy games, videogames, basktball, brainteasers etc.
                    I believe it is important to have many hobbies, but I am most passionate
                    about computing and the creative nature of writing code using a programming
                    language.
                </p>
